- [NFT preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U/hub/nft-preview-card-component-_Wt184YEK) [My Solution](https://draghonite.github.io/front-end-mentor-level-1/#/nft-preview-card)
- ...

## My process

### Built with

Several technologies and techniques were used in the process, including:
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

In order to allow building many designs in a single Vue.js application, a modular architectural pattern was followed in the structure of the Vue.js project, along with careful and consistent CSS/Sass styling.

## Acknowledgments

- (Base64 Image Encoder)[https://elmah.io/tools/base64-image-encoder/]
  - it's just so much easier to base-64 encode images (.png, .jpg or even .svg) and add as a background via CSS than to reference external resources, especially given the modular project strucutre.  This online tool was pivotal in this strategy.
