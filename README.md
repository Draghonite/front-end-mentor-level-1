## My process

### Built with

Several technologies and techniques were used in the process, including:
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile First Design
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

In order to allow building many designs in a single Vue.js application, a scalable, modular architectural pattern was followed in the structure of the Vue.js project, along with careful and consistent CSS/Sass styling.

## Acknowledgments

- [Base64 Image Encoder](https://elmah.io/tools/base64-image-encoder/)
  - I found it easier and cleaner to base-64 encode images (.png, .jpg and .svg) and add as a background via CSS than to reference external resources, especially given the modular project structure.  This online tool was pivotal in this strategy.
- [Making Shapes with CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY7Rj8aZcZk) and [Before and After pseudo elements explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI)
  - Kevin Powell is a CSS guru, and in these videos, he lays down a solid foundation for understanding *::before and *::after pseudo elements in CSS.  The second link leads to a 3-part series...a true gem.
